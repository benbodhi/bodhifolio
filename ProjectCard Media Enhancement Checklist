# ProjectCard Media Enhancement Checklist

## Core Requirements
- [x] Support responsive media with natural aspect ratios
- [x] Allow mixed media types (images and videos) in the same carousel
- [x] Support specifying the order of media items
- [x] Add option to designate a cover media item
- [x] Enable videos to play both inline and in lightbox
- [x] Implement dynamic container sizing for the carousel

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Update Project Type Structure
- [x] Create a unified `MediaItem` type
  ```typescript
  type MediaItem = {
    type: 'image' | 'video';
    src: string;
    isCover?: boolean; // Optional flag to mark an item as the cover
  }
  ```
- [x] Update the `Project` type to use the new media structure
  ```typescript
  type Project = {
    // existing fields...
    media?: MediaItem[];
    // Remove or deprecate: image, images, videoUrl
  }
  ```
- [x] Add migration strategy for existing projects

### 2. Create Unified Media Components
- [x] Develop a `MediaRenderer` component that can handle both images and videos
- [x] Remove forced aspect ratio constraints
- [x] Ensure full-width display with automatic height based on content
- [x] Support responsive sizing for all media types

### 3. Enhance Carousel Functionality
- [x] Update carousel to handle mixed media types
- [x] Implement smooth transitions between items with different aspect ratios
- [x] Add support for dynamic container sizing
- [x] Ensure proper playback controls for videos in the carousel

### 4. Implement Cover Media Feature
- [x] Add logic to identify and display the cover media item
- [x] Ensure clicking the cover opens the lightbox with all media items
- [x] Maintain the carousel functionality when no cover is specified

### 5. Enhance Lightbox Integration
- [x] Update lightbox to support video playback
- [x] Ensure proper sizing and controls for videos in the lightbox
- [x] Maintain smooth navigation between different media types in the lightbox

### 6. Testing and Refinement
- [ ] Test with various media aspect ratios
- [ ] Test with different combinations of images and videos
- [ ] Ensure smooth transitions and responsive behavior
- [ ] Verify lightbox functionality with mixed media
- [ ] Test cover media feature

### 7. Documentation and Examples
- [x] Update project data to use the new media format
- [ ] Document best practices for aspect ratio management
- [ ] Create examples of different media configurations

## Additional Considerations
- [x] Performance optimization for video loading
- [x] Accessibility improvements for media controls
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness testing
- [ ] Fallback strategies for unsupported media types or formats
